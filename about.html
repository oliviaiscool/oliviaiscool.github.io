            <p class="blurb font"> Olivia is a freshman at a private day school in Queens, New York City. Her hobbies include musical theater, recreational mathematics, astronomy and learning as much as she can about computer science, programming and game design. She lives in New York with her family and their cat and you can often find her knee-deep in crossword puzzles or watching too much BBC Sherlock. </p>
