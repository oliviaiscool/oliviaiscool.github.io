        <p>OLIVIA MCKAYLA ROSS 👼🏿🏹 is an 18 year old media 📺💿 artist and programmer from Queens, New York City 🏙.  
            She hopes to help others model 🌐💅🏿 their own practices of exploding💥 conventional dichotomies 🔳🔲
             of user vs. programmer and noise🌫 vs. signal⚡️, while also building a framework for 
             interrogating the faith economies that underlay electronics and communications technologies. 
             How is faith and trust 🤥 distributed between users and programmer? How is faith 
             monopolized, accumulated, recycled, exchanged, embodied, assigned and weaponized 💔💔💔 between 
             people, systems, ideals and materials? Emboldened by her perspective as a <em>digital native</em> 
             she hopes her work will encourage her fellow teens to nurture a critical 🤨relationship with technology.</p>

             <p>She is a recent alum of the School for Poetic Computation and has taught at Black Girls Code, BUFU and POWRPLNT. Olivia is currently represented by talent development agency <a id='links' href="http://www.instagram.com/sow.nyc"> Scope of Work</a>.
