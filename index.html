        <p>Olivia McKayla Ross (August 28, 2001–forever) is a Caribbean American video artist, programmer and poet from Queens, New York City. Her work is inspired by the relationship between electronic video and vanity--by deep fantasy, Instagram filters, glamour magic, mirrors and the fantasies and anxieties of video transmission: immersion, absorption, surveillance and control. How are faith and trust distributed between users and programmer? How is faith monopolized, accumulated, recycled, exchanged, embodied, assigned and weaponized between people, systems, ideals and materials? Emboldened by her perspective as a <em>digital native</em> 
             she hopes her work will encourage her fellow teens to nurture a critical relationship with technology.</p>

             <p>She is a recent alum of the School for Poetic Computation and has taught at <a id="social" href="www.blackgirlscode.com"> Black Girls Code</a>, <a id="social" href="https://www.instagram.com/bufu_byusforus/"> BUFU</a> and <a id="social" href="https://www.powrplnt.org/"> POWRPLNT</a>.
